# MidiFlip

Transform MIDI songs to create mathematical remixes.
Made for/inspired by Andrew Huang's [#MidiFlip "challenge"](https://youtu.be/4IAZY7JdSHU).

MidiFlip can be used to simply flip notes around,
but it also gives you raw control over the notes in a simple way so you can make arbitrary remappings.

You'll be able to batch convert a bunch of files by specifying a glob on the CLI.

However, the CLI isn't exposed yet and
currently all percussion and instruments are switched around,
which is pretty interesting musically, so that'll be an option,
but it won't be the default behavior.
